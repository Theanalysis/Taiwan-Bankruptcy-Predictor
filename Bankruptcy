# Taiwan Bankruptcy Prediction Project from Worldquant university

## 📌 About This Project

This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a company will go bankrupt based on financial data.

The dataset contains financial information about Taiwanese companies and a target column called **bankrupt**:
- 0 → Company is not bankrupt
- 1 → Company is bankrupt

This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow from data loading to model deployment.

## 🧠 What I Did

In this project, I:

✔ Loaded compressed JSON data  
✔ Cleaned and prepared the dataset  
✔ Checked for missing values  
✔ Visualized class imbalance  
✔ Split data into training and test sets  
✔ Handled imbalanced data using over-sampling  
✔ Trained a Random Forest model  
✔ Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV  
✔ Evaluated the model using confusion matrix and classification report  
✔ Saved the trained model  
✔ Created a prediction function for deployment

## 📊 Model Used

- RandomForestClassifier
- Cross-validation (5 folds)
- GridSearchCV for tuning

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Accuracy

---

## 🚀 Deployment

I created a Python module:

`my_predictor_assignment.py`

It contains:
- `wrangle()` → loads and prepares new data
- `make_predictions()` → loads the saved model and returns predictions

Example:

```python
from my_predictor_assignment import make_predictions

y_pred = make_predictions(
    data_filepath="data/taiwan-bankruptcy-data-test-features.json.gz",
    model_filepath="model-5-5.pkl"
)
